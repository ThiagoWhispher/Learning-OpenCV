    1. **What is Digital Image Processing?**
An image may be defined as a two-dimensional function *f(x,y)*, where *x* and *y* are spatial (plane) coordinates, and the amplitude of *f* at any pair of coordinates *(x,y)* is called the *intensity* or *gray level* of the image at that point. When *x, y*, and the amplitude values of *f* are all finite, discrete quantities, we call the image a *digital image*. [...]
*Pixel* (each of which has a particular location and value) is the term most widely used to denote the elements of digital image. [...]
*Vision* is the most advanced of our senses, [...]. However, unlike humans, who are limited to the visual band of the electromagnetic spectrum [...]
One useful paradigm is to consided three types of computerized processes in the continuum: *low-, mid-, and high-level processes*.
*Low-level process: involve primitive operations such as image preprocessing to reduce noise, contrast enhancement, and image sharpening. (inputs and outputs are images).
*Mid-level process: involves tasks such as segmentation (partitioning an image into regions or objects), description of those objects to reduce them to a form suitable for computer processing, and classification (recognition) of individual objects. (Inputs - images, outputs are attributes extracted from those images: contours, edges, and the indentity of individual objects).
*High-level processing: involves "making sense" of an ensemble of recognized objects, as in image analysis, and, at the far end of the continuum, performing the cognitive functions normally associated with vision.
