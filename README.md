1. **Introduction**
    1. **What is Digital Image Processing?**
        * An image may be defined as a two-dimensional function *f(x,y)*, where *x* and *y* are spatial (plane) coordinates, and the amplitude of *f* at any pair of coordinates *(x,y)* is called the *intensity* or *gray level* of the image at that point. When *x, y*, and the amplitude values of *f* are all finite, discrete quantities, we call the image a *digital image*.
        * *Pixel* (each of which has a particular location and value) is the term most widely used to denote the elements of digital image.
        *Vision* is the most advanced of our senses, [...]. However, unlike humans, who are limited to the visual band of the electromagnetic spectrum [...]
        * One useful paradigm is to consided three types of computerized processes in the continuum: *low-, mid-, and high-level processes*.
	        * Low-level process: involve primitive operations such as image preprocessing to reduce noise, contrast enhancement, and image sharpening. (inputs and outputs are images).
	        * Mid-level process: involves tasks such as segmentation (partitioning an image into regions or objects), description of those objects to reduce them to a form suitable for computer processing, and classification (recognition) of individual objects. (Inputs - images, outputs are attributes extracted from those images: contours, edges, and the indentity of individual objects).
	        * High-level processing: involves "making sense" of an ensemble of recognized objects, as in image analysis, and, at the far end of the continuum, performing the cognitive functions normally associated with vision.

## *Main parts of the PDF (Learning OpenCV)*
1. **Overview**
	1. **What is OpenCV?**
        * OpenCV is an open source computer vision library [...], written in C and C++. The library was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications.
        * One of OpenCVâ€™s goals is to provide a simple-to-use computer vision infrastructure that helps people build fairly sophisticated vision applications quickly. Th e OpenCV library contains over 500 functions that span many areas in vision, including factory product inspection, medical imaging, security, user interface, camera calibration, stereo
vision, and robotics.
	2. **Who uses OpenCV?**
        * The open source license for OpenCV has been structured such that you can build a commercial product using all or part of OpenCV. [...] In part because of these liberal licensing terms, there is a large user community that includes people from major companies (IBM, Microsoft , Intel, SONY, Siemens, and Google, to name only a few) and research centers (such as Stanford, MIT, CMU, Cambridge, and INRIA). OpenCV is popular around the world, with large user communities in China, Japan,
Russia, Europe, and Israel.
